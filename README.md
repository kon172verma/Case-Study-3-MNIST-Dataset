# Case-Study-3-MNIST-Dataset

MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. 
The black and white images from NIST were normalized to fit into a 28x28 pixel bounding box and anti-aliased, which introduced grayscale levels.
The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
We have downloaded this MNIST dataset from Kaggle using this link:

We wish to apply the following Dimensionality Reduction Techniques on this dataset to reduce its dimensionality from 784 to a very less number :
* PCA
* t-SNE
